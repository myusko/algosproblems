# A palindrome is a string or sequence of characters that reads the same backward and forward.
# For example, "madam" is a palindrome.
# Write a function that takes in a string and returns a Boolean -> True if the input string is a palindrome and False
# if it is not. An empty string is considered a palindrome.
# You also need to account for the space character.
# For example, "race car" should return False as read backward it is "rac ecar".


def is_palindrome(input_string):
    return input_string == input_string[::-1]
